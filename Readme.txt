UNCROPPED DATA VIEWER TOOL

Cropped screenshots and images within Microsoft files such as PowerPoint, Excel and Word documents, can reveal the portions of the area deleted, but not completely removed.

There is a risk that sensitive information of a much higher sensitivity classification to the document in question, could be revealed. Restricting editing rights within Microsoft program will not prevent this and there is no `patch’.  Low classification files can therefore still present a risk of sensitive data leakage leading to reputational damage, network and system compromise.

Fully removing cropped data is an easy mistake to make – he fault lies principally in not knowing the steps required to ensure that cropped material is fully deleted along with the lack of a software control that does this automatically. Even when people know how to do this, it is easy to forget to perform the steps necessary to do this, which are:
Within a Microsoft document, click on `Picture Tools' > `Format' > `Compress Pictures' > `Delete cropped areas of pictures', whilst un-checking the box `Apply only to this picture’. Saving any Microsoft documents as a PDF, also prevents this issue.

Examples of sensitive data could be anything visible on one’s desktop at the time of either performing the screenshot or using images, such as:
 Employee details
 Opened emails and sensitive files
 Calendar entries
 Network and system details
 Social media profiles and messages
 Customer and client details
 Corporate applications

This tool helps to find files that are unintentionally exposing such data.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Microsoft Excel must be installed. Third party Excel add-ins should ideally be disabled or removed as sometimes they cause errors.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Unzip the program and in the main folder. No `installation' is necessary.  

Open the .exe file and click on `Add Files' to add those files you want to check. Only .xlsx, .docx and .pptx files can be reliably checked at present in this version.  Then click on `Extract'.

When the program has finished running, the results will be saved in a .xls file which will appear in the program folder.

Open this file and check all the worksheets inside for all the images extracted along with any of their undeleted data that may be visible. One image is saved per worksheet.
